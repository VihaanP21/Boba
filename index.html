    <h1> VIRAT KOHLI </h1>
    <h2>THE <b>GOAT</b> OF CRICKET</h2>
    <h3>Virat Kohli is regarded as the GOAT in cricket due to his unparalleled consistency, adaptability, and impact across all formats. With over 70 international centuries, he’s among the greatest run-scorers, excelling in high-pressure chases, earning him the title "Chase Master."

        Kohli’s dominance spans Test, ODI, and T20I cricket, where he redefined modern batting standards. He was the fastest to reach milestones like 8,000, 9,000, and 10,000 ODI runs. His aggressive captaincy transformed India into a top Test team, with historic overseas wins, especially in Australia.
        
        Beyond records, Kohli’s fitness revolution inspired a new era in cricket, emphasizing athleticism. His passion and work ethic resonate globally, making him one of the most followed athletes.
        
        In every aspect—batting, leadership, and influence—Kohli’s legacy cements his place as one of cricket’s all-time greats, embodying excellence and inspiring future generations.
